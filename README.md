 Open-source font inspired by [Poster-Film Collective](https://www.poster-collective.org/poster-collective-bio) posters found in the [May Day Rooms](https://maydayrooms.org/) archive. 

 For now, I have used uppercase and lowercase features to display two uppercase fonts with variations. This is useful for creating that handwritten look in bigger bodies of text, but I realise a lowercase character set would also be valuable. I intend to work on this more.
